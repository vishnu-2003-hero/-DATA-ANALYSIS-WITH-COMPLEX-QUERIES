## As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I undertook an advanced data analysis project (Task-2) that centered on harnessing SQLâ€™s robust querying capabilities. My focus was on extracting detailed insights and trends from multi-layered datasets using a combination of:
- Window Functions: Used for calculating running totals, ranks, partitions, and comparisons across rows without collapsing data
- Subqueries: Embedded logic within SELECT statements to filter, calculate, and shape the analysis dynamically
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Structured complex logic into readable and reusable segments, improving query maintainability and clarity
This task deepened my expertise in analytical SQL, enabling me to write highly optimized, business-relevant queries and build datasets that answered nuanced questions. The experience bolstered my confidence in designing scalable solutions for real-world data challenges.
